# pythagoras

Transpiles some Python into human-readable Golang.

## Feature Support

See docs/features.csv

- No X means no meaningful support as of yet. 
- Decent+ means there's at least extensive support, and I may not have thought of a way it could break yet. 
- Limited means there's at least some facet of programming in place that deals with this (either explicitly or implicitly),
 although there may be serious limitations. Check the notes for more.

## Examples

All examples presented here are used as tests for the program.

## TODOs

Some things I'd like to add soon...

- "value in range(start, stop, step)" => a conditional statement
- Exhaustive implementation of list/dict/int/float/bytes methods
-
