# pythagoras

Transpiles some Python into human-readable Golang.

## Support

See docs/features.csv

- No X means no meaningful support as of yet. 
- Decent+ means there's at least extensive support, and I may not have thought of a way it could break yet. 
- Limited means there's at least some facet of programming in place that deals with this (either explicitly or implicitly),
 although there may be serious limitations. Check the notes for more.
